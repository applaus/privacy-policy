# Terms and Conditions
### Introduction
By using and shopping with Applaus, you accept the conditions below. The Terms & Conditions are updated on a regular basis, so we recommend that you keep up to date on this. Applaus exclusively sell tickets on behalf of the venues. In the unprecedented case that there should be any confusion of these Terms & Conditions the Danish version will be treated as the Master version.

### Payment Refund
Purchased tickets are not refundable under normal circumstances. In case of cancellation, however, please refer to the responsible organiser for further information and a possible refund. Tickets are in the event of cancellation in principle always refunded to the ticket buyer (according to the "Law on certain consumer agreements, Section 17, paragraph 2, cf. Section 9, paragraph 2, item 2a", the purchase of tickets is NOT covered by the cancellation right).

As a ticket broker, Applaus is not liable for repayment in case of a cancellation. Applause seeks to ensure that organisers refund the ticket purchase sums in case of cancellations but cannot assume any commercial responsibility for this.

### Reservations for Event Changes
Applaus reserves the right to cancel issued tickets against refund of the ticket price and any fees. The organiser also reserves the right to change the placement in the same category of tickets in special cases and to transfer the ticket to another category against payment of a possible price difference. We also take reservation for errors and omissions in prices and descriptions - including sold out events.

### Our Responsibility as a Ticket Broker
Applaus has no responsibility regarding organisers' reconstruction, suspension of payments, bankruptcy, cancellation of events, other deficiencies or any other claims regarding an event. All inquiries should be addressed to the organiser. Information about the organiser's full name, address, telephone number, etc. can be found in the app, at www.applaus.io or by calling tel. +45 26 28 39 06.

### Event Cancellation
In case of cancellation, please refer to the responsible organiser for further information and possible refund. The organiser reserves the right to replace the ticket with a similar artist / event. Changes in repertoire, date, partial performance of an event are not considered as cancelled, so the money for this is not refundable. See the organiser's information about the event.

### Ticket Payment
At Applaus, payment is received with the following payment cards: VISA/Dankort, VISA, MasterCard and American Express. All costs are shown in the shown ticket price. The price shown to begin with will therefore be the final price. Personal identifiable information is stored and transmitted in a closed network. There is therefore no access to this information from the internet. All information regarding payments is sent encrypted to the Stripe payment service.

### Ticket Resale
It is, according to the "Law on Resale of Culture and Sports Events Tickets" ("Lov om videresalg af billetter til kultur- og idrætsarrangementer"), not allowed to sell and resell tickets at a premium in Denmark. This means, for example, that it is forbidden to resell tickets for a profit.

### Event Restrictions
Also, please keep in mind that on the individual events there may be other or additional restrictions in relation to the transferability of the tickets. Tickets may not be used commercially for package sales, competitions, resale or the like unless the organiser has given permission.

### Event Access
Check the ticket information, including event, date / time and venue is correct. Access is granted against redeeming the purchased ticket(s), either on the app or in the browser. Illegal copying or resale of tickets may lead to denied access to the event. Applaus and the organiser are not responsible for problems caused by illegal copying and / or resale of tickets. Read more about event-specific events during the event here at Applaus and on the organiser's website.

### Complaints over Receiving Unsolicited Marketing Material
